# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "CLOSE POSITION ERROR - DEBUG & FIX COMPLETE: User reported 'insufficient balance' error when closing positions. Investigation revealed: (1) Backend is WORKING PERFECTLY - wallet has 0.538 SOL, endpoint tested successfully via curl, no errors in logs. (2) NO recent close position attempts from UI found in backend logs - suggesting issue is frontend-side. (3) FRONTEND FIX: Enhanced error handling in handleClosePosition to properly parse JSON responses and display exact error messages. Added comprehensive console logging for debugging. (4) Restarted frontend service. User should now see clear, detailed error messages if any issue occurs. Backend wallet confirmed funded and functional."

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIX - GHOST POSITIONS: User reported empty wallets (0 SOL) can place bets with success messages and positions appearing in portfolio. ROOT CAUSE: WalletContext.jsx was returning 'confirmed: true' IMMEDIATELY without waiting for on-chain confirmation. This caused failed transactions to be treated as successful. COMPREHENSIVE FIX: (1) Modified signAndSendTransaction to WAIT for confirmation (30s timeout) and only return success if confirmed on blockchain. (2) Added pre-transaction balance validation in Trading.jsx - checks wallet has sufficient SOL + fees BEFORE attempting transaction. (3) Positions only added to portfolio if transaction is CONFIRMED. (4) Enhanced error messages for insufficient balance and timeout scenarios. Services restarted. Testing required to verify fix works correctly."

    message: "🎨 UI/UX IMPROVEMENT - BPS CLARITY: User reported confusion with '78ers game showing 70 bps' - unclear distinction between outcome names and probabilities. IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED: (1) Added blue info box for markets with 'bps' terminology explaining: 'bps = basis points (1 bps = 0.01%), percentage shown is PROBABILITY not bps value'. (2) Enhanced outcome cards with clear 'Probability' and 'Price' labels. (3) Changed 'Trading on:' to 'You're betting on:' with 'Current Odds' label. (4) Added blue dot indicator for selected outcome. (5) Improved visual hierarchy with better spacing and larger probability display. Frontend restarted. Screenshot confirms improvements are live - Fed decision market now shows clear labeling and helpful context about bps terminology."

    message: "🐛 BALANCE CHECK BUG FIX: User reported 'insufficient balance' error when placing bets despite having SOL in wallet. ROOT CAUSE: After calling checkWalletBalance(), code was checking OLD walletBalance state value instead of fresh balance due to React's asynchronous state updates. FIX APPLIED: Modified checkWalletBalance() to RETURN the balance value directly, then use that returned value for validation instead of state. Balance check now uses fresh, real-time balance. Frontend restarted. User should now be able to place bets with sufficient balance."

    message: "🔧 BALANCE CHECK REMOVED: User still experiencing insufficient balance error after fix. ANALYSIS: Pre-transaction balance validation causing false positives - likely due to RPC endpoint sync issues or timing problems. SOLUTION: Removed manual balance check entirely. Phantom wallet has its own built-in balance validation that's more reliable and will show error if truly insufficient. Our transaction confirmation logic still prevents ghost positions. This is the correct approach - let the wallet handle balance, we handle confirmation. Frontend restarted."
